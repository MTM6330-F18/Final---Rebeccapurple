                    Structured on building upon students experience with content management systems, stressing the importance of creating modern, dynamic, API’s & SPAs to be used with responsive websites. Students explore databases which store and output content while changing interface elements based on user interactions with PHP scripting language, form handling, SQL databases and queries.  Other topic covered include CRUD, routes, views, models and controllers.  Informative tutorials links were provided for additional independent study.

                    Michael records his class lectures providing students with access for remote learning and additional review.

                    Students were assessed based on Group Project (40%), Individual Assignments (40%) and Independent Study (20%).

                    Students completed an ‘interests survey’ and were formed into groups based on the results.  Learners were required to create a user-friendly and functional interface using database tables and code shared through a GitHub repository. Detailed documentation was provided with instructions on how to use the project.  Teams presented a demonstration of the finished product to the professor.

                Individual assignments consisted of using PHP to create HTML to randomly generate 100 dominoes on the page.  Using multidimensional, associate arrays, conditional statements and retrieving variables from the URL learners create an interactive maze.  The third assignment, students create a simple and interactive fishing game by demonstrating the use of functions, conditional statements, HTTP variables and PHP. Finally, students validate their understanding of SQL Queries, by creating queries that create, read, update and delete (CRUD) data from the provided Seussology database.

                    Students choose and research topics related to server-side web development.  A total of five discussion posts were written and shared with IMD peers on specific due dates.  Each post explained their chosen topic, related functions, statements, variables or techniques and citations were required and provided.
